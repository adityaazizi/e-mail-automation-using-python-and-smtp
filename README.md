# E-Mail Automation using Python

I created this project after learning programming with Python as an implementation of the basic knowledge and concepts I have acquired. With this program, we can send emails with a subject, attachment, and of course, the message content automatically to multiple recipients listed in `receiver_list.txt`. Of course, this program can only run on the CLI for now, and I might add a UI to make it more user-friendly in the future.

## Steps to Run the Program

1. **Clone this repository to your device:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-sender.git
   cd email-sender
   ```

2. **Fill in the required information:**

   - Open the `email_sender.py` file and provide your email username.
   - Create an app password following the steps [here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en).
   - Specify the attachment path if needed.

3. **Prepare Attachments:**
   If using an attachment, make sure all attachment files are placed in the `attachment` folder.

4. **Run the Program:**

   ```bash
   python email_sender.py
   ```

5. **Once everything is ready, run the program, and the email will be sent to all recipients listed in `receiver_list.txt`.**

## Future Updates

I am planning to add a user-friendly UI to make the program more accessible in the future. Stay tuned for updates!
